This is my final project for the Code Louisville JavaScript/React Course.

In order to explore the site launch simply clone the repository to your local machine.  You should be able to launch the project by typing "npm start" in your console.  The tabs at the top of the page route to 2 different pages.  The home page, and two other pages where you can either search for comics by character name, or search for comics by artist name.  Some characters and artists don't return any comics from the API, which will result in an error.  If this happens refresh the page and try a different search.
