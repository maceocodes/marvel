This is my final project for the Code Louisville JavaScript/React Course.

In order to explore the application simply clone the repository to your local machine.  Cd into the project folder and install node js by running "npm install" in your console.  Once that's coompleted run "npm start" in your console which should launch the application.  The tabs at the top of the page route to 3 different pages.  The home page, and two other pages where you can either search for comics by character name, or search for comics by artist name.  Some characters and artists don't return any comics from the API, which will result in an error.  If this happens refresh the page and try a different search.  It's repsonsive, but it's not pretty...yet.
